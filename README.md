Cybersecurity Projects
Created by Michael Tran
Everything was coded in Python

This repository contains a series of Python scripts designed to showcase my skills and demonstrate my journey towards becoming a cybersecurity engineer. These projects focus on key areas of cybersecurity, including password security, network scanning, web vulnerability assessment, and IP geolocation. They are educational tools, intended to help me further develop my understanding of cybersecurity concepts and techniques.

Projects
1. IP Geolocation Finder
Description: This script allows you to look up the geographical location of an IP address using the ipinfo.io API. It provides details such as the city, region, country, and organization associated with the IP.

Skills Demonstrated: Networking, using APIs, and basic data retrieval.

How to Use:

Run the script.
Enter an IP address when prompted.
The script will display the geographical details of the IP address.
Optionally, you can check additional IP addresses or exit after each query.
2. Password Strength Checker
Description: This script evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria such as length, the inclusion of uppercase letters, digits, special characters, and checking for common patterns. It also integrates with the "Have I Been Pwned" API to see if the password has been breached.

Skills Demonstrated: Password security analysis, cryptographic hashing, and API integration.

How to Use:

Run the script.
Enter the password you want to check.
The script will display the strength of the password and suggest improvements if necessary.
3. Password Generator
Description: This tool generates secure passwords based on user preferences, including options for length, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. It helps users create strong, random passwords for secure authentication.

Skills Demonstrated: Random number generation, string manipulation, and user input handling.

How to Use:

Run the script.
Choose the length and whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
The script will generate and display a strong password based on your choices.
4. Port Scanner
Description: This script scans a range of ports on a target host to check for open ports. It's useful for identifying services running on a system and testing for potential vulnerabilities in those services.

Skills Demonstrated: Networking, socket programming, and multi-threading for efficient scanning.

How to Use:

Run the script.
Enter the target host IP address and the port range to scan.
The script will attempt to connect to each port in the range and report if any ports are open.
5. Web Vulnerability Scanner
Description: This script scans a target website for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and directory traversal. It sends test payloads to the website and checks the response to identify potential weaknesses.

Skills Demonstrated: Web application security, penetration testing, and HTTP request manipulation.

How to Use:

Run the script.
Enter the target URL you want to scan for vulnerabilities.
The script will check for several common security issues and display the results.
